# This project analyzes customer churn data to understand the key factors driving customer attrition and to build a predictive model. The goal is to identify patterns in customer behavior and train a machine learning model to classify whether a customer is likely to churn.

Tasks performed:
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Encoding and Scaling
4. Model Building and Evaluation
5. Model Deployment

Dataset source: Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle.
