# Customer Churn Predictive Analysis

This project analyzes customer churn data in order to understand the key factors driving customer attrition and to build a predictive model.  
The goal is to identify patterns in customer behavior and train a Linear Regression model to classify whether a customer is likely to churn.

## Tasks Performed

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Encoding and Scaling  
4. Model Building and Evaluation  
5. Model Deployment (Azure-ready)

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Telco Customer Churn dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
